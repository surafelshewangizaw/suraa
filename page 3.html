        <h1>How Does Blockchain Technology Work?</h1>
        In recent years, you may have noticed many businesses around the world integrating
        Blockchain technology. But how exactly does Blockchain technology work? Is this a
        significant change or a simple addition? The advancements of Blockchain are still young
        and have the potential to be revolutionary in the future; so, let’s begin demystifying this
        technology.<br></br>
        Blockchain is a combination of three leading technologies:
        <ol>
<li>Cryptographic keys</li>
<li>A peer-to-peer network containing a shared ledger</li>
<li> A means of computing, to store the transactions and records of the network</li>
        </ol>
        Cryptography keys consist of two keys – Private key and Public key. These keys help in
        performing successful transactions between two parties. Each individual has these two
        keys, which they use to produce a secure digital identity reference. This secured identity
        is the most important aspect of Blockchain technology. In the world of cryptocurrency,
        this identity is referred to as ‘digital signature’ and is used for authorizing and controlling
        transactions.<br><br>
        The digital signature is merged with the peer-to-peer network; a large number of
        individuals who act as authorities use the digital signature in order to reach a consensus
        on transactions, among other issues. When they authorize a deal, it is certified by a
        mathematical verification, which results in a successful secured transaction between the
        two network-connected parties. So to sum it up, Blockchain users employ cryptography
        keys to perform different types of digital interactions over the peer-to-peer network.
