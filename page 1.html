    <h1>What is block chain technology?</h1>
    Block chain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as
    the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network
    connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a ‘digital
    ledger.’<br></br>
    Every transaction in this ledger is authorized by the digital signature of the owner, which
    authenticates the transaction and safeguards it from tampering. Hence, the information
    the digital ledger contains is highly secure.<br></br>
    In simpler words, the digital ledger is like a Google spreadsheet shared among
    numerous computers in a network, in which, the transactional records are stored based
    on actual purchases. The fascinating angle is that anybody can see the data, but they
    can’t corrupt it.<br></br>
